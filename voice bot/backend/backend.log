Pedestrians should cross only at designated zebra crossings and only when the pedestrian signal is green, or when the vehicle traffic light is red. Crossing against a green light for vehicles is unsafe and can lead to penalties.

2025-11-28 21:59:32,058 - INFO - AI Response: Namaste! When you're crossing a road in Delhi or any Indian state, you should cross when the pedestrian signal is green. If there isn't a separate pedestrian signal, you should cross when the vehicle traffic light for the road you are crossing is red, and it is safe for you to cross. Always make sure to look both ways and cross carefully.

Are you asking about a particular intersection or situation?

2025-11-28 22:04:57,155 - INFO - Sending text to Gemini...
2025-11-28 22:05:01,296 - INFO - AI Response: Hello! In Delhi, a green light is primarily for vehicles to proceed. Pedestrians should ideally cross the road when the pedestrian signal shows a 'walk' sign (often a green human figure) or when the vehicular traffic light is red, and it's safe to cross, usually at a designated zebra crossing.

Crossing on a green light meant for vehicles can be dangerous and is generally not permitted if it impedes traffic.

Are you referring to a specific type of crossing, like one with a zebra crossing but no separate pedestrian signal?

2025-11-28 22:05:55,006 - INFO - Sending text to Gemini...
2025-11-28 22:05:57,001 - INFO - AI Response: Certainly. If you are at a zebra crossing in Delhi and there is no separate pedestrian signal, the general rule is to wait until the vehicular traffic light for vehicles going in your direction is red.

When the traffic light for vehicles is red, they are supposed to stop, and that is usually the safest and correct time for pedestrians to use the zebra crossing to cross the road. Always ensure vehicles have stopped completely before you step onto the crossing.

Does this clarify your question?
